## Variables Basics

Variables store data in memory.

**rules for declaring the variable**

- number are not allowed at the first
- spaces are not allowed
- avoid special charracters
- case sensitive (Name != name)

### mistake

1variable = 10 which is wrong

Reason:
Variable name does not starts with a number

### my learnings

variable are the container which stores value as in the memory address


q4 >> i learn that string is concat with another string and if an integer is concat with string then type coersion is required to the int data

q5>> we found the results as 22 because the precidence of the operator in this case ( ** ) is more operand after that ( * )multiplication then after    ( + )
