## Variables Basics

Variables store data in memory.

**rules for declaring the variable**

- number are not allowed at the first
- spaces are not allowed
- avoid special charracters
- case sensitive (Name != name)

### mistake

1variable = 10 which is wrong

Reason:
Variable name does not starts with a number

### my learnings

variable are the container which stores value as in the memory address
